# CryptoChat Application

## Overview

The Secure Chat Application is a web-based chat application that ensures end-to-end encryption, meaning that the server does not have access to any messages exchanged between clients. This is achieved using asymmetric RSA encryption, where each client generates a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The backend server is implemented using Spring Boot with WebSocket, serving solely as a mediator for message transmission.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the messages.
- **Asymmetric RSA Algorithm**: Each client generates a pair of keys (public and private). Public keys are exchanged for encryption purposes, while private keys remain confidential.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: The backend server operates with Spring Boot and WebSocket, functioning only as a message broker.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and clean user interface that allows users to send and receive messages easily.

## How It Works

1. **Key Generation**: Each client generates their own pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) upon clicking the "Generate Keys" button.
2. **Public Key Exchange**: Clients can enter the recipient's public key to send encrypted messages.
3. **Message Encryption**: When a message is sent, it is encrypted using the recipient's public key.
4. **Message Transmission**: The encrypted message is sent to the Spring Boot backend server, which forwards it to the intended recipient without decrypting it.
5. **Message Decryption**: Upon receiving a message, the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message and read its content.
6. **Message Logging**: The application logs all sent and received messages for the user's reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the application.
  - **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality and cryptographic operations.
  - **SockJS**: For WebSocket communication.
  - **STOMP**: For messaging protocol.
  - **JSEncrypt**: For RSA encryption and decryption.
  - **CryptoJS**: For additional cryptographic functionalities.

- **Backend**:
  - **Spring Boot**: For building the backend server.
  - **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between clients.


The following instructions describe how to install the necessary tools, run the application, and access it once it's running.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer
- Gradle 

## Installation

### 1. Install the JDK

To run the project, you need the JDK. Follow these steps to install the JDK on a Linux distribution:

1. Update your package list:
   
   sudo apt update

2. Install OpenJDK 11 (or a newer version):

   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

### 2. Install Gradle

  sudo apt install gradle

Note: This project also includes the Gradle wrapper (gradlew), so you can run the application without installing Gradle system-wide. Just use ./gradlew instead of gradle in the following commands if you prefer using the wrapper.

### Running the Project

To start the Spring Boot server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd /path/to/your/project

2. Run the application with Gradle:

   ./gradlew bootRun

or, if Gradle is installed system-wide: 
  
  gradle bootRun 


Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, you can open a browser and go to the following address to access the application:

  http://localhost:8080


Important Note on Using the Generate Keys Feature

When using the Generate Keys feature:

  After pressing the "Generate Keys" button, youâ€™ll need to enter the Recipient Public Key.

  Make sure to provide the public key in the full required format, including both the header and footer. For example:

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGdfSIb3DdfEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCGoJjiedqR/w1io7o/oBfIq435-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
